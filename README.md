# Gym Buddy Application

<h3>Solo React Project<h3>
<hr/>
<p>
My goal for this project is to create a functional, user-friendly gym-assistance app.
The iOS App Store offers very little in terms of a cheap, user-friendly 
gym app that makes for simple but effective generation of workouts, and tracking of exercise volume and time.

This app will offer a simple but and free option for gym users who want to add
utility to their workouts. Here are the stages of the app (Current: Version 1)

(V1) Users can generate a workout based on inputs such as the muscles they want to train, the difficulty, and more.
(V2) Users can save workouts that they have generated and make a customisable collection
(V3) Stopwatch and set/rep tracker will allow users to track all metrics of their workout
