# Gym Buddy Application

<h3>Solo React Project<h3>
<hr/>
<p>
My goal for this project was to create a functional, gym-assistance app.
The iOS App Store offers very little in terms of a cheap, user-friendly 
gym app that makes for simple but effective tracking of exercise volume and time.

This app will offer a simple but and free option for gym users who want to add
utility to their workouts such as 

(1) a stopwatch with lap and reset functionality
(2) a set/rep tracker
(3) links to external tutorials for specific exercises
